#
# If you wish to deploy to multiple regions from a single git repo (verses the alternative of running a git repo per
# region with a CloudGenesis deployed for each of those repos, in their respective region) then you must deploy this
# stack in each region.
#
# This stack will setup the SNS topic for CloudFormation events in each region that the CF events in that region will
# pipe to. CloudFormation does not support cross-region SNS publishing. So this is a "shim" to assist with that process.
